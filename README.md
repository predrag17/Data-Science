# Data Science

This repository contains various tasks and experiments related to **Data Science**. The main focus is on:

- **Testing machine learning models**: Implementing and evaluating different machine learning models for various tasks.
- **Learning and experimenting with different models**: Exploring various machine learning algorithms such as regression, classification.
- **Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearch**: Optimizing model performance using techniques like GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.
- **Data preprocessing**: Preparing datasets for machine learning, including tasks like feature scaling, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables.

## Key Tasks and Components

1. **Model Training & Testing**:
   - Training machine learning models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and more.
   - Evaluating model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Using GridSearchCV to search for the best hyperparameters for models.
   - Experimenting with different hyperparameter combinations to achieve optimal performance.

3. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning data, handling missing values, and scaling features using techniques like Standardization and Normalization.
   - Encoding categorical variables using methods like One-Hot Encoding and Label Encoding.

4. **Notebooks & Scripts**:
